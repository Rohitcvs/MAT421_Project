        "   Financial institutions process large volumes of loan applications every day, requiring quick yet accurate decisions. A reliable predictive model can mitigate default risks, enhance customer satisfaction, and optimize resource allocation. My project aims to build a loan-approval prediction system using logistic regrssion (and potentially other machine-learning models) to classify loan applications as approved or not approved based on applicants demographic, financial, and credit-history details.\n",

Traditional methods (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) are favored for interpretability, while more advanced techniques (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) sometimes yield higher accuracy. In practice, logistic regression remains a strong baseline for loan prediction due to its transparency and ease of implementation.\n",

Our emphasis on logistic regression ensures that the model remains interpretable for financial stakeholders, while our planned evaluations (accuracy, precision, recall) address the practical needs of risk management. The final deliverable will be a reproducible set of Python scripts/notebooks and a thorough analysis of the results, paving the way for potential deployment in real-world lending environments."
